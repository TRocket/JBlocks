1:
    I am working here on a BlockEditor.
    I saw that you are working on one too...

    Can you stop this and start with "Block-Store" for blocks?
    I think we should add an integrated "Block-Store" where you can share 
    and download blocks (native and "BYOB-Blocks").
    A native block could be a static method in a class, and a "BYOB-Block"
    could be a block which people can create like in BYOB.
    Can you organize a server for the Block-Store too?
    Thanks!

    I am not sure it is a good idea to use JFrames.
    I think we should put all in a "JBlocksPane" which we can put in a JFrame
    AND a JApplet.

    Cool! I saw you have found a greenflag icon!
    But we shouldn't start the blocks yet.
    It would be better if we make them at the end.
    And we shouldn't put the source of the blocks in "org.jblocks".
    We should load them from an external .jar file.
    And we should use blockspec parsing instead of new classes which "extends JHatBlock".
    
    I think the block.xml files should look similar to this:

    <block native="true" type="hat" spec="when %img{greenflag} pressed">
        <code jar="blocks.jar" class="org.jblocks.blocks.GreenFlagPressedHatBlock.class" />
        ...
    </block>

    And then we can use your code to load the class...
    What do you think about that?
    And why don't you answer me anymore? ;)
        ( can't you understand my english? :/ )
