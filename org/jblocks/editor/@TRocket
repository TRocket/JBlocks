1:
    I am working here on a BlockEditor.
    I saw that you are working on one too...

    Can you stop this and start with "Block-Store" for blocks?
    I think we should add an integrated "Block-Store" where you can share 
    and download blocks (native and "BYOB-Blocks").
    A native block could be a static method in a class, and a "BYOB-Block"
    could be a block which people can create like in BYOB.
    Can you organize a server for the Block-Store too?
    Thanks!

2: 
    I am not sure it is a good idea to use JFrames.
    I think we should put all in a "JBlocksPane" which we can put in a JFrame
    AND a JApplet.


What do you think about that?
(I hope you can understand my english)
